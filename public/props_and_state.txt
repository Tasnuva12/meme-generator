props --> refers to the properties being passed into a component
in order for it to work correctly, similar to how a function receives 
parameters : "from above " 

A component receiving props is not allowed to modify those props.

(they are immutable)

Note : never change props inside a component because the props are sent 
for a particular  property .
Suppose you wrote a function which will receive a, b as integer and 
add them . will you want to change a,b's value inside the function?
definitely not ! 


State--> values that are managed by the component , similar to 
variables declared inside a function. Any time you have changing values 
that should be saved /displayed , you'll likely be using state.
 /**
     * Note: if you ever need the old value of state
     * to help you determine the new value of state,
     * you should pass a callback function to your
     * state setter function instead of using
     * state directly. This callback function will
     * receive the old value of state as its parameter,
     * which you can then use to determine your new
     * value of state.
